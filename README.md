# Hello-World-
My first repository on GitHub

Hi my name i Admir, i am born in 07.11.2005 and this is my first ever repository. 

My main focus in this years semester in IT (informasjons tenkologi) is to learn how to code. I am currently not working on much, but i am doing my homework. Other than school, i enjoy playing golf, i like playing Call of Duty with my friends, and having a good time with my family.
